# slackin

A little server that enables public access to a Slack server. Like Freenode, but on Slack.

It provides

- A landing page you can point users to fill in their
  emails and receive an invite (`https://slack.yourdomain.com`)
- An `<iframe>` badge to embed on any website
  that shows connected users in *realtime* with socket.io.
- A SVG badge that works well from static mediums
  (like GitHub README pages)

Originally forked from [rauchg](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin).

Updated by [87maza](https://github.com/87maza/slacker) to get the Heroku deployment to work.

## Credits

- The SVG badge generation was taken from the
excellent [shields](https://github.com/badges/shields) project.
- The button CSS is based on
[github-buttons](https://github.com/mdo/github-buttons).
